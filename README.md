# e6l-ruby
Take e621 with you, Ruby+MongoDB style.

## Quick start
While it doesn't do much right now, you can use the development version easily:
```
$> gem install curb os toml
$> git clone https://github.com/CyberYiff/e6l-ruby.git && cd e6l-ruby
$> mv settings.json.new settings.json   # Or manually change settings
$> ./test.rb
```
